Multithreaded File Compression Tool

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a high-performance C++ application designed to compress and decompress large files using multithreading for optimized speed and efficiency. Traditional file compression tools process data sequentially, which becomes a bottleneck with large files. This tool overcomes that limitation by splitting input files into chunks and processing each chunk in parallel using multiple threads. The result is significantly faster compression and decompression times, especially on multi-core systems.

Built with the C++17 Standard Library and the popular zlib compression library, this project showcases how multithreading can be used in real-world scenarios to boost performance and resource utilization.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Multithreaded Compression: File is divided into equal-sized chunks and compressed in parallel by multiple threads.

âœ… Multithreaded Decompression: Compressed chunks are decompressed concurrently and reassembled in the correct order.

âœ… Chunk-Based Design: Efficient memory and CPU usage; works well for large files.

âœ… Performance Measurement: Built-in timing mechanism to measure execution time of compression and decompression phases.

âœ… Cross-Platform: Uses only standard C++ and zlib, making it portable across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Compression Phase:

The input file is read and split into fixed-size chunks (e.g., 1 MB).

Each chunk is assigned to a separate thread.

Threads compress their chunks using zlib::compress2.

The compressed data and metadata (original size, chunk index) are written to a binary file.

2. Decompression Phase:

The compressed file is read and chunk metadata is parsed.

Each chunk is handed to a separate thread.

Threads decompress the data using zlib::uncompress.

The decompressed chunks are combined and saved in the correct order.

3. Timing:

Execution times for both compression and decompression are printed, allowing you to benchmark performance against single-threaded tools.

ðŸ§ª Performance Gains

The tool demonstrates clear performance benefits by leveraging parallelism. For instance, on a typical 4-core CPU:

A 100MB file might compress in under 0.5 seconds, compared to 2â€“3 seconds in a single-threaded version.

Decompression shows even better speedups, thanks to the reduced computational load per chunk.


Actual performance depends on:

File size

Number of available CPU cores

Disk I/O speed
